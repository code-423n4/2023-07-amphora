hello. hope we can secure this protocol together


[07/21/2023 22:20] 0k_sec
can the team provide details in the SCOPE section in the contest, this way we have an idea what contracts are about.


[07/21/2023 22:22] tofunmi
the scope is on the contest page

hi @adamscochran ; just wondering why a vault could simply call modifyTotalDeposited directly? seems not associated with any token transfer


[07/22/2023 12:31] sanket.kogekar
What command are you guys using to run unit tests? Say I want to run the test function `testWstEthOracle()`. Anyone can answer.


[07/22/2023 13:12] alymurtazamemon
`forge test --mt testWstEthOracle`

also for some tests you need the MAINNET_RPC make sure to add it in the .env file.

Not entirely sure what you mean? They are calling that function, but the function is in the VaultController?

The reason to keep it in the vaultController rather than a vault is that we deem the Vault Controller to be the true source of legitimate vaults, and the core piece that is migratable to new versions.

Let me know if I am missing the point of your question though!

[07/22/2023 18:08] adamscochran
I think it would depend on the type of impact and scale of it. Like if it’s a gas thing probably not, but if it’s a critical issue, not accurately captured by the bot finding, then maybe?

Can you please clarify the intended conversion rate of cvx/crv rewards to AMPH?


[07/22/2023 21:25] adamscochran
It’s on a diminishing curve per epoch. We only measure the CRV amount, and emit AMPH based on that. The amount per epoch declines pretty rapidly, and an epoch is based on how much total CRV has been collected by the protocol.

(Pretty similar to how CVX emits in the Convex protocol)

[07/22/2023 21:26] 0xdeo
What's the formula?


[07/22/2023 21:47] adamscochran
It's the AmphClaimer.sol; and can be seen on the docs: https://amphora-protocol.gitbook.io/amphora-protocol/

But it could be expressed as: =1+(((25000/(MAX(TotalAmph,50000000)/(8,000,000)))))-((TotalAmph/8,000,000)/50)

any help would be much appreciated


[07/23/2023 18:54] adamscochran
A factor is an expression of a rate, but can be expressed in a different scale, which is useful when you’ve got changing conversion rates.

@adamscochran Why are you using `SafeERC20Upgradeable` in `depositERC20` in `Vault.sol` ?


[07/24/2023 14:46] adamscochran
Since we don't create the tokens - it's possible that some old tokens may not be fully compliant with ERC20 and so using the SafeERC20 wrapper is for ensuring that it has the proper formated return


[07/24/2023 15:18] proxy1967

Got a lot of DM questions and I’m answering any that are related to the protocol.

But I am skipping questions that are extremely basic things like “where is this function used” or “how does this solidity thing work”

Will double check for your specific question, but wanted to explain in general that the team isn’t taking time on super basic questions like that. Which may be better asked to peers here

Well. we have worked with a lot of sponsors. they also got a lot of DMs you are not first one. the only target they have is helping in anything in order to make audit process faster. 
cause we don't want to waste even some minutes to figure out simple things that you already know the answer. instead we want to focus on important parts. 
fine i understand you are busy with Dms. but answering most of questions will help auditors to understand well in *fast period of time*  then why we need you we already have the codes  

Sincerely.

I agree with the part that why would a sponsor answer basic things , but I think If I'm having my protocol audited , this x amount of days for the audit would be the most crucial days for my protocol , so why not answer everything who knows it might help in finding a bug  , but I get both the arguments


[07/26/2023 20:26] adamscochran
His questions involved where a function was in the code (which could have been fixed with a control+F) and why the token had a transfer function, which can be summed up as… you need to transfer the token.


[07/26/2023 20:31] maugzeth
Agreed, if you are asking these types of questions auditing might not be for you... this just takes sponsors time away from the important and blocking questions.

ohh auditors can discuss in github issues,during judging??  i was thinking only judges and sponsors can discuss

Not during judging, unless the judge or sponsors asks you to do it. 
Warden’s comments are allowed until the QA phase

I submitted a QA report. But my dashboard says 0 audits. Did my report got rejected or something?


[08/20/2023 18:48] 0xstalin
it was either rejected or it didn't meet the criteria of a Grade-A report, I believe only Grade-A QA reports are awarded (but I may be wrong)

I submitted a lot of reports, the fifth project received an award. Now when I find a problem, I write test code to verify it.
